include files
remove folder/files
backups of different kinds: database, commands, include files (zip), etc
handle recursive folders
create config file for every transfer
regex for uplaod, delete and print structure
manager recursive shortcuts (probably check levels for each file, get their id and if same id matched compare levels, use shortest level files)

for deleting, using delete command and include files will delete files but not directory. to delete directory i have to use rclone purge, and for that i have to know who created the folder. Hopefully i can use drive api for that. lets see. 
when uploading a single, no need to use include file (works as expected so not priority)
